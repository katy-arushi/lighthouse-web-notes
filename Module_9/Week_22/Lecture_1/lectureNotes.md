### Ruby

- use uppercase var names when you want to think of them as constant

- ruby is more strict about types, doesn't do type conversion
  - 7 == '7'
    - false

- string interpolation is using single quotes and hashtag
```ruby
name = Cocoa
species = hedgehog
print "#{name} is a #{species}"
```
