## Networking With TCP and HTTP

This is sample chat using "net" in nodeJS.
You can run the server.js and several instances of the client.js to see how each client's messages are propagated to all the other clients.

Also look at the [SLIDES](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_e4uW9UWH1w9PmFUJwovvkEIqZG8IFA_MoyZKTnU5FI/edit?usp=sharing) for more information about TCP and HTTP.
