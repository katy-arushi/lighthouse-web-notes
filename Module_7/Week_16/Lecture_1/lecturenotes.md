## What is React?
  - components based UI
  - React is declarative
    - going to mention your goals - what you want at the end
    - SQL is also declarative
    - jQuery is imperative - you have to specify everything, how to traverse DOM tree, etc.
  - component based
    - built once and then can use wherever you want without having to build it again
    - just like functions that accept with parameters, make use of them rather than hardcoding data and variables in the function, to make them more reuseable
