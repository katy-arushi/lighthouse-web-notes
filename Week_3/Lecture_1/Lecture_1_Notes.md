# W02D1 - lecture - Test Driven Development with mocha and chai

- We discussed what is Test Driven Development(TDD) and its benefits. Also we saw how we can write tests for our functions using :

  - mocha
  - chai
- We talked a little bit about making our code modular by exporting and requiring the functions.
